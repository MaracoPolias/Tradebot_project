Automated Trading Bot (v0.01)
Welcome to the repository for our automated trading bot, currently in its initial and experimental release v0.01. This project is a community-driven initiative aimed at building and sharing tools for algorithmic trading research and development. The entire codebase is open-source and operates under the principles of the GNU General Public License (GPL), ensuring transparency and collaborative development.
License and Open-Source Philosophy
The use of the GNU GPL license means this software is free to use, study, share, and modify. This aligns with our commitment to open development. We believe in the power of the community to audit, improve, and expand upon these tools. You are encouraged to fork the repository, experiment with different strategies, and share your enhancements with others under the same licensing terms.
